<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a game where you play as different characters and fight evil robots. Has rougeLike item mechanics to keep each run fresh and allow for a variety of different types of builds. Fight your way through different locations and unlock all the characters. Feel free to send in item requests and contribute ideas to the development for SFRL.

<!-- PLANS AND STATUS -->
## Plans and Status

Pre-Alpha Version 0.1 is out now.

To keep check the general ideas and what is done in development process go to this link: https://app.milanote.com/1NOg8m1w3ht90G?p=1YL2fcsGvyY

<!-- PRE ALPHA -->
## Pre-Alpha

The pre-alpha has the following...

Norman(Player Character)
Primary Fire: An energy rifle that does moderate damage.

Secondary Fire: Hold down to charge up a powerful shot that pierces anything it hits until it contacts a wall.

Ability 1: Projects a energy shield in front of norman that blocks all incoming projectiles. (Binded to Q)

Ability 2: Norman throws a grenade that deals massive damage. Can be thrown threw walls and explodes on enemy contact. (Binded to E)

Dash: Norman has a tactical roll which allows him to dodge projectiles and move quickly for a breif moment. (Binded to Shift)

4 Enemy types, SwordBot, PistolBot, RifleBot, and MachineGunBot

1 Boss, Extremely Velocious Executor or EVE

EVE moves very quickly around the player and will stop to unload tons of blaster bolts toward the player.

19 Items to help you through the rounds purchased at vending machines around the map.

<!-- KNOWN BUGS -->
## Known Bugs

Norman being too fast can occasionally glitch into the walls.

Vending machines if bought quickly will only give the same item (However cannot confirm or deny if its actually a problem might just be luck)
